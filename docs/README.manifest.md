# Manifests

Manifests are descriptions of the repositories that are to be included in the build. The
repositories may be from the same organization or from different organizations. The manifest
files are stored in the .repo/manifests path upon initialization by the repo command. The
presence of a repository in layers/* does not automatically add it to the bitbake layers.
